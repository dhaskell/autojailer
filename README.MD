## Autojailer - Minecraft Spigot/Bukkit Plugin

Designed to work in tandem with [Bukkit Essentials](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials/), specifically the feature allowing for admin-specified 'jails'. This plugin acts as a soft-whitelist, sending previously unseen players to a random jail until they are vouched for by X number of establish players. Ignores OP'd players.

**To-Do's**
- New Commands
  - List players who vouched for X player
  - Revoke existing vouches / re-jail player
- Better exception handling
